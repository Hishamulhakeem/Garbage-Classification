# Garbage Classification

This project focuses on classifying garbage into different categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to automate waste segregation and support recycling efforts through accurate image-based classification.

## 📘 Project Description
The notebook `garbage.ipynb` demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a **garbage classification model**. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Model building using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Performance analysis with accuracy metrics and confusion matrix  

By classifying waste into predefined categories (e.g., **plastic, paper, metal, organic, glass**), the model aims to improve waste management efficiency.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Open `garbage.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
2. Run all cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess dataset  
   - Train the CNN model  
   - Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results  
3. Modify hyperparameters or model architecture to improve accuracy.  

## 📈 Results
The notebook displays performance metrics and sample predictions, highlighting how well the model distinguishes between different garbage categories.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of garbage images, typically grouped into recyclable and non-recyclable categories. (You can replace the dataset path in the notebook with your own.)

## 🧾 License
This project is open-source and available for educational purposes.

Would you like me to make this **shorter and simpler (student-style)** or keep it **professional and GitHub-ready** like this version?
